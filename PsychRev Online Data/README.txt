README for Hills, Jones, & Todd, in review
Psychological Review

Title:  Retrieval from Semantic Memory Adheres to Optimal Foraging Theory

The files included in this online supplement will allow one to recreate the analyses, tables, and graphs produced for the above article.

Items Needed:
Python (with scipy module:  www.scipy.org )
R

All files in this folder should be placed in a common file.

To perform the SAM analysis/simulation used to generate Table 1, run SamPsychRevTable1.py from the common folder, using Python.  Then use 'notes table 1.R' in R to import the data and produce results for BIC analyses.

To produce figures 1 through 5, open an R interface, set directory to the common folder containing the files, and run the commands in the DataAnalysis_online.R notes file.
