# Optimal Foraging in Memory Retrieval: Evaluating Random Walks and Metropolis-Hastings Sampling in Modern Semantic Spaces

Human semantic retrieval processes resemble foraging behaviors observed in ecological settings, where individuals exploit local resource patches before strategically shifting to new areas—a pattern well-explained by the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT). While previous behavioral studies and computational models using traditional semantic networks have revealed foraging-like patterns in human verbal fluency, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art, high-dimensional semantic embeddings can replicate these behaviors. This knowledge gap persists despite the rapid advancement of embedding models, from classic approaches such as BEAGLE to cutting-edge, large-scale models like OpenAI’s text-embedding-large-3, which capture richer contextual and relational information.

In this study, we systematically evaluate whether random walks on modern embedding spaces more closely emulate human memory retrieval patterns than older, more static semantic networks. We then introduce a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling framework that dynamically incorporates MVT-inspired constraints, using acceptance criteria that balance the exploitation of intra-cluster similarity against exploratory cluster-switching. By enforcing “high order” priors—capturing nuanced semantic relationships and encouraging timely cluster exits—MH provides a more adaptive retrieval process.

To further optimize the embedding space, we generate succinct, descriptive sentences for each animal stimulus via a GPT-4o-mini model, and then embed these descriptions using text-embedding-large-3. This additional context yields more defined cluster structures, enabling the adaptive MH sampler to outperform simpler random walks in replicating human-like retrieval patterns, including more natural inter-response times (IRTs) and cluster transitions. These enhancements challenge Abbott’s (2015) skepticism regarding the adequacy of semantic embeddings and support Hills’ (2012) argument that richer, more contextually informed semantic spaces can indeed facilitate optimal foraging behavior.

Overall, our findings demonstrate that modern embeddings, enriched with descriptive priors and sampled adaptively via MH, can reliably reproduce human semantic foraging patterns. This underscores both the flexibility of embedding-based approaches and their potential to yield deeper insights into human cognitive processes, setting the stage for future explorations in adaptive semantic search, hierarchical sampling, and more human-aligned models of memory retrieval.
